# Baseband_Coding
Baseband coding improves communication reliability by applying encoding and decoding techniques. It adds redundancy, detects and corrects errors, enhancing data transmission efficiency. Techniques include line coding, block codes, convolutional codes, and turbo codes.

# About Repository
i maked this script python for visualization technique of coding on baseband 

# Types of coding 
I have six type in this repository :
### 1- RZ
### 2- NRZ
### 3- NRZI
### 4- Manchester
### 5- Deffertial Manchester
### 6- Miller

# Modules used

I used tow modules in this script :
### mathplot "for visualization the signal " .
### numpy .

# How to use this script ? 
### firstly
Choice one of this codes I choce code number 1 NRZ in this exmple
### secondly 
enter your binary Data ! must be space between bit and bit

# Exmple :

```
+++++++++++++++++++ Base Band Coding Types +++++++++++++++++++++
1 --> NRZ
2 --> RZ
3 --> NRZI
4 --> Manchester
5 --> Differential_Manchester
6 --> MILLER
Choice One Of This Code  :  1
Enter Your Binary Sequence : 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
```
